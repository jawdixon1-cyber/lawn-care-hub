    content: '<h2>How to make standards more than words on a screen</h2><p>Having a Standards page in the app is step one. Making your crew actually live those values and responsibilities is the real work. This playbook is your system for turning standards into culture.</p>' +
      '<h2>Make It Part of the Routine</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Day-one walkthrough:</strong> Every new hire sits down and reads the Standards page together with you on their first day. Don\'t just hand them a phone — walk through each value and each responsibility. Explain <em>why</em> each one matters. <mark>Why: If they don\'t hear it from you directly, it\'s just another screen they\'ll forget.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Reference by number:</strong> When giving feedback, tie it to a specific responsibility. "Hey, that\'s number 5 — communicate issues immediately." Using the number system makes it fast and clear. <mark>Why: A shared shorthand builds accountability without long lectures.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Weekly meeting review:</strong> Pick one value or responsibility each week and spend 2 minutes discussing it in your team meeting. Ask: "Who has an example of this from the past week?" <mark>Why: Repetition is how values move from a page into people\'s heads.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Tie It to Accountability</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Use it in corrections:</strong> When someone misses a checklist or doesn\'t log mileage, don\'t make it personal — point to the Standards page. "This is the standard for the seat. It\'s not a surprise." <mark>Why: Making standards black and white removes emotion from accountability conversations.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Performance check-ins:</strong> In one-on-ones, go through all 5 responsibilities: "How are you doing on each of these?" Let them self-assess first, then share your view. <mark>Why: Self-assessment builds ownership. If they know the standard, they can hold themselves to it.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Track what you can:</strong> Checklist completion rates, mileage logs, receipt submissions — these are measurable. Review them weekly. If someone is at 60% checklist completion, the conversation is easy: the standard is 100%. <mark>Why: Data removes opinion from performance conversations.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Lead with the Values</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Catch people doing it right:</strong> When someone goes the extra mile, call it out publicly. "That right there — that\'s Go the Extra Mile. That\'s what we\'re about." <mark>Why: Public recognition of values in action is the strongest culture-building tool you have.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Correct through values, not frustration:</strong> When someone cuts corners, tie it back: "That\'s not Give a Damn. We don\'t leave a property looking like that." <mark>Why: Values-based correction feels like coaching, not criticism. It\'s about the standard, not the person.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Model it yourself:</strong> If you expect Clean Finish Clean Reset but your truck is a mess, you\'ve lost credibility. Live the values louder than you preach them. <mark>Why: Your crew watches what you do, not what you say.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>The Repetition Rule</h2><p><strong>Say the values and responsibilities so often that your crew can recite them without looking at the app.</strong> That\'s the benchmark. If you ask a crew member "What are our 3 values?" and they hesitate, you haven\'t said it enough yet.</p>' +
      '<p>Culture isn\'t built in a meeting — it\'s built in the 100 small moments every week where you either reinforce the standard or let it slide. The Standards page gives you the tool. This playbook is how you use it.</p>',

Reviewing them every Friday makes accountability automatic and gives people a chance to fix it next week.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>To-do review (3 min):</strong> Go through last week\'s to-dos. Done or not done. No stories, no excuses.

Move to #2. Repeat until time\'s up. <mark>Why: Most meetings waste time on easy stuff. IDS forces you to tackle the hard problems first.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Next week preview (2 min):</strong> Any schedule changes? Anyone out? Big jobs coming? Give the crew a heads-up so they\'re not surprised Monday morning. <mark>Why: People perform better when they know what\'s coming. No one likes Monday surprises.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Wrap up (2 min):</strong> Recap new to-dos. Each to-do has an owner and a deadline. "Have a good weekend — see you Monday." End on time. <mark>Why: It\'s Friday. Respect people\'s time. A meeting that runs over on a Friday kills morale fast.</mark></li>' +

      '<li><strong>Ask, don\'t assume:</strong> "What happened?" before "Here\'s what you did wrong." Sometimes there\'s context you don\'t have. <mark>Why: Asking first shows respect and sometimes reveals a real problem you can help solve.</mark></li>' +

    content: '<h2>How to approach someone cold and walk away with a yes</h2><p>Door knocking and cold approaches are the fastest way to fill your route — if you do it right. Most people fail because they pitch too early. The goal of the first 30 seconds isn\'t to sell. It\'s to not get rejected.</p>' +
      '<h2>Before You Knock</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Target the right doors:</strong> Look for signs — overgrown lawn, weeds in beds, no fresh mow lines. These people either don\'t have a service or aren\'t happy with the one they have. <mark>Why: Knocking on a perfect lawn is wasted time. Look for pain first.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Work the neighbor effect:</strong> If you just finished a property that looks great, knock on the neighbors\' doors. "Hey, I just finished up next door at [address]..." <mark>Why: Social proof is the most powerful sales tool. People want what their neighbors have.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Look the part:</strong> Clean uniform, truck visible from the door, professional appearance. You have 3 seconds before they decide if you\'re trustworthy. <mark>Why: People buy from people they trust. Trust starts with appearance.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>The Approach (First 30 Seconds)</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Smile, step back, hands visible:</strong> After you knock, take a step back from the door. Hands out of your pockets. Relaxed posture. <mark>Why: A stranger at the door triggers a threat response. Stepping back and being open with your body language lowers their guard.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Name and context, not a pitch:</strong> "Hey, I\'m [Name] with Hey Jude\'s — we just finished up at your neighbor\'s place at [address]." That\'s it. Stop talking. <mark>Why: Context before pitch. You\'re not a random salesperson — you\'re the guy who just made the neighbor\'s lawn look great. Let that sink in.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Compliment or observe, don\'t criticize:</strong> "You\'ve got a really nice property" or "Looks like you\'ve got a big yard to keep up with." Never say "your lawn looks bad." <mark>Why: Nobody buys from someone who insulted them. A compliment opens the conversation. An observation about size or difficulty creates a natural opening for your offer.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>The Conversation (Not a Pitch)</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Ask, don\'t tell:</strong> "Are you handling the lawn yourself right now, or do you have someone?" Let them talk. <mark>Why: Questions create engagement. Statements create resistance. The more they talk, the more they sell themselves.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Find the pain:</strong> If they do it themselves: "That\'s a lot of work — how many hours a week does that take you?" If they have a service: "How\'s that going for you?" <mark>Why: You\'re looking for frustration — time spent, inconsistent quality, unreliable service. That\'s your opening.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Mirror their pain back:</strong> "Yeah, that\'s what I hear a lot — guys showing up whenever they feel like it." <mark>Why: Mirroring is the most powerful rapport technique. When someone feels understood, they trust you. It\'s psychology — not manipulation, just good listening.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Offer the easy next step:</strong> "Tell you what — I\'m already in the neighborhood every [day]. Let me put together a quick quote, no obligation. I can have it to you by tonight." <mark>Why: Low commitment, high convenience. You\'re not asking them to sign a contract on the doorstep — just to receive a quote. The barrier is almost zero.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Psychology Principles at Work</h2><ul>' +
      '<li><strong>Proximity bias:</strong> "I\'m already in the neighborhood" makes you convenient, not pushy</li>' +
      '<li><strong>Social proof:</strong> "I just finished your neighbor\'s place" — if it\'s good enough for them, it\'s good enough for me</li>' +
      '<li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> Give a genuine compliment or helpful observation before asking for anything</li>' +
      '<li><strong>Loss aversion:</strong> "We only have a couple spots left on our [day] route" — people fear missing out more than they desire gaining</li>' +
      '<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Get small yeses first (yes to a quote, yes to a phone number) — people who say yes once are more likely to say yes again</li>' +

      '<h2>Before You Arrive</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Do your homework:</strong> Satellite measure the property before you get there. Know the approximate square footage, lot layout, and what you\'re going to charge before you step out of the truck. <mark>Why: Walking the property while fumbling with a measuring wheel screams amateur. Showing up with numbers ready screams professional.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Look up the neighborhood:</strong> Are you already servicing nearby? Know the names. "I take care of the Johnsons two doors down." <mark>Why: It\'s not just social proof — it tells them you\'re already here and adding them is easy.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>The Walk-Around</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Walk WITH them, not ahead of them:</strong> "Want to walk the property with me? I want to make sure I understand exactly what you\'re looking for." <mark>Why: Walking together creates partnership. Walking ahead of them feels like an inspection. Side by side, you\'re on the same team.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Ask about their priorities:</strong> "What matters most to you — keeping it looking sharp every week, or are you more focused on keeping costs down?" <mark>Why: This tells you how to frame your price. Quality-focused clients hear "premium service." Budget-focused clients hear "best value in the area."</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Point out things they didn\'t notice:</strong> "See how the grass is thinning here under this tree? That\'s a shade issue — we can overseed with a shade mix in the fall and it\'ll fill right in." <mark>Why: Free expertise builds massive trust. You just demonstrated you know more than the last guy. Now they want YOU, not just a lawn service.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Identify upsell opportunities but don\'t push them:</strong> Note the beds, the edging, the tree line. Mention it casually: "Your beds could really pop with fresh mulch — that\'s something we can add later if you want." <mark>Why: Planting the seed now means they\'ll come back to you for it later. Don\'t cram everything into the first sale.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Presenting the Price</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Use monthly pricing:</strong> "$180 a month" lands softer than "$45 a visit times 4." Monthly feels like a subscription. Per-visit feels like a transaction. <mark>Why: Monthly pricing reduces the perceived cost and increases commitment. People cancel transactions; they maintain subscriptions.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Anchor high, offer value:</strong> "A property this size typically runs $200–220 a month. Because I\'m already on this street, I can do $180." <mark>Why: Anchoring sets the frame. The first number they hear becomes the reference point. Everything after that feels like a deal.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Shut up after the price:</strong> Say the number. Then stop talking. Let them respond. <mark>Why: The first person to talk after the price loses. Silence creates space for them to say yes. If you keep talking, you\'re negotiating against yourself.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Handling Objections</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>"I need to think about it":</strong> "Totally understand. What specifically are you weighing?" Then address that specific concern. <mark>Why: "I need to think about it" usually means one specific thing is holding them back. Find it and solve it.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>"That\'s more than I expected":</strong> "What were you expecting?" Let them name a number. Then: "I can\'t hit that number and deliver the quality I showed you on the Johnsons\' lawn. But here\'s what I can do..." <mark>Why: Never just drop your price. Reframe value first. If you drop without pushback, they think you were overcharging.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>"I want to get a few quotes":</strong> "Smart move. When you\'re comparing, make sure they include [edging, blowing, detailed trimming] — a lot of guys quote cheap and skip the detail work." <mark>Why: You just made yourself the standard they judge others against. And you planted doubt about the cheaper guys without saying anything negative.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>The Close</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Assume the sale:</strong> "I\'ve got an opening on Tuesdays — does that work for you, or is another day better?" <mark>Why: An assumptive close skips "do you want to?" and goes straight to "when do we start?" It works because most people are ready — they just need a nudge.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Make it instant:</strong> "I can get you on the schedule this week. I\'ll send the agreement to your phone right now — takes 30 seconds to sign." <mark>Why: Speed kills hesitation. The longer between "yes" and signing, the more likely they talk themselves out of it.</mark></li>' +

    content: '<h2>The mental models that make people say yes</h2><p>Sales isn\'t about tricks — it\'s about understanding how people make decisions and removing the barriers between "interested" and "yes." These principles work in every conversation, not just sales.</p>' +
      '<h2>The Big 6 Principles</h2><ol>' +
      '<li><strong>Reciprocity — Give first, always:</strong> Give a free tip, a genuine compliment, a quick observation about their property. When you give something of value with no strings attached, people feel compelled to give back. "Your irrigation head on the south side is spraying the sidewalk — easy fix, just twist it 15 degrees." They didn\'t ask for that. Now they feel like they owe you. <mark>Why: Humans are wired to return favors. A 10-second tip can be worth a $2,000/year contract.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Social Proof — Show, don\'t tell:</strong> "I take care of 6 properties on this street" beats "we do great work" every time. Before/after photos on your phone. Google reviews pulled up and ready. The neighbor\'s lawn looking perfect right next door. <mark>Why: People don\'t trust what you say about yourself. They trust what other people say — and what they can see with their own eyes.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Scarcity — Limited spots, not limited time:</strong> "We only have two openings left on our Thursday route" is honest and effective. Don\'t fake urgency with countdown timers or "today only" nonsense. But real scarcity — route capacity — is powerful and true. <mark>Why: People procrastinate unless there\'s a reason not to. Real scarcity gives them that reason.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Authority — Look and sound like the expert:</strong> Clean truck, clean uniform, confident handshake. Know the grass type on their lawn without asking. Reference specific techniques: "We run a 3.5-inch cut on fescue this time of year — goes to 4 inches in July to hold moisture." <mark>Why: People follow experts. Every detail you know that they don\'t builds your authority. They stop comparing you on price and start comparing you on competence.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Consistency — Get small yeses first:</strong> "Mind if I take a quick look at the backyard?" Yes. "Would it help if I put together a quick quote?" Yes. "Can I grab your number to send it over?" Yes. By the time you ask for the sale, they\'ve already said yes three times. <mark>Why: People want to be consistent with their past behavior. Each small yes makes the big yes feel natural.</mark></li>' +
      '<li><strong>Liking — Be a human, not a salesperson:</strong> Use their name. Notice their dog. Comment on the garden they clearly put work into. Find one thing you genuinely have in common and mention it. <mark>Why: People buy from people they like. And people like people who notice them, remember details, and feel real — not rehearsed.</mark></li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Tactical Moves</h2><ul>' +
      '<li><strong>The takeaway:</strong> "Honestly, with your lot size, you might not even need full weekly service — maybe biweekly would be enough." Taking something OFF the table makes people want it more. They\'ll often talk themselves into the bigger package.</li>' +
      '<li><strong>The feel-felt-found:</strong> When someone objects: "I totally get how you feel. A lot of my clients felt the same way at first. What they found was [specific benefit]." This validates their concern without arguing.</li>' +
      '<li><strong>The silence close:</strong> After you state the price or ask for the sale, stop talking. Count to 10 in your head. The person who speaks first loses leverage. Let them fill the silence — it\'s almost always with a yes or a solvable objection.</li>' +
      '<li><strong>The Ben Franklin close:</strong> If they\'re on the fence: "Let\'s just list it out — what are the pros and what are the cons?" Physically list them. The pros will always outnumber the cons because you\'ve been building value the whole conversation.</li>' +
      '<li><strong>Name repetition:</strong> Use their name 3–4 times in the conversation. Not every sentence — that\'s creepy. But enough that it registers. "So John, based on what you told me..." People light up when they hear their own name. It builds instant rapport.</li>' +
      '</ul>' +
      '<h2>The #1 Rule</h2><p><strong>Listen more than you talk.</strong> The best salespeople talk 30% of the time and listen 70%. Every question you ask gives you ammo to close. Every time you talk without listening, you\'re guessing at what they want. Stop guessing. Start asking.</p>',
